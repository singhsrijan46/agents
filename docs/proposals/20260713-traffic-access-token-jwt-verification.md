# TrafficAccessToken JWT Verification via OIDC

## Summary

This proposal adds offline JWT verification for the `trafficAccessToken` used
to access a Sandbox through sandbox-gateway. When JWT authentication is enabled,
each gateway process loads the identity provider CA from Kubernetes, performs
OIDC discovery, downloads a JWKS snapshot, and verifies every request locally.

The gateway binds signed `sandboxId` and `sandboxUid` claims to the selected
route, preventing a valid token for one Sandbox from being replayed against
another or against a replacement Sandbox with the same name. Token issuance
and delivery to clients remain owned by the identity integration and are not
changed by this proposal.

The feature is disabled by default through Envoy filter configuration. Existing
clusters retain their current behavior until both `enable-auth` and
`enable-jwt-auth` are set to `true`.

## Goals

- Verify JWT signatures using asymmetric public keys obtained through OIDC.
- Require and validate `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `iss`, and non-empty `sub` claims.
- Bind tokens to the current Sandbox ID and immutable Sandbox UID.
- Keep the request path offline after verifier initialization.
- Fail closed while an enabled verifier is unavailable.
- Preserve existing UUID authentication when JWT authentication is disabled.
- Keep configuration and dependencies out of sandbox-manager's controller-only
  feature-gate package.

## Non-Goals

- Audience or subject-policy authorization beyond requiring a non-empty `sub`.
- Authorization based on arbitrary signed `metadata` claims.
- Binding Pod name, namespace, or UID. These are not present in the shared
  gateway route model.
- Token introspection, revocation, or opaque-token support.
- Automatic CA or JWKS refresh. A gateway rollout is required after rotation.
- Returning replacement tokens issued by the security-token refresh controller.
- Issuing traffic tokens or adding a manager API that returns them to clients.
- Changing Sandbox claim, clone, or E2B create response behavior.
- Supporting more than one issuer per gateway process.

## Behavioral Contract

Gateway authentication has three valid modes:

| `enable-auth` | `enable-jwt-auth` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `false` | `false` | Authentication disabled. |
| `true` | `false` | Existing `x-access-token` UUID authentication. |
| `true` | `true` | JWT authentication using the traffic-token header. UUID validation is bypassed. |

`enable-jwt-auth=true` with `enable-auth=false` is invalid configuration.

JWT mode intentionally replaces, rather than augments, UUID authentication.
The `x-access-token` header remains untouched and is forwarded transparently.
This lets applications use that header independently while gateway access is
authorized by the JWT.

The traffic-token header defaults to `x-traffic-access-token` and is
configurable. It must be a valid HTTP header name and must differ from
`x-access-token`. Its value is a compact JWT, not an `Authorization: Bearer`
value. After successful verification, the gateway removes this header before
forwarding the request to the Sandbox.

## Token Claims

The initial claim shape is:

```json
{
  "exp": 1784102400,
  "iat": 1784098800,
  "nbf": 1784098800,
  "iss": "https://identity.example",
  "sub": "e2b:controlplane:client",
  "sandbox": {
    "sandboxId": "default--sample",
    "sandboxUid": "89d24507-936c-4a04-a958-b5d6a8277ed5"
  }
}
```

Verification is split into two stages:

1. `pkg/identity/oidc` validates the signature and registered claims.
2. `pkg/sandbox-gateway/filter` compares `sandbox.sandboxId` and
   `sandbox.sandboxUid` with `Route.ID` and `Route.UID`.

Required claim behavior:

| Claim | Validation |
|---|---|
| `exp` | Present and not expired, allowing configured clock skew. |
| `iat` | Present and not in the future beyond configured clock skew. |
| `nbf` | Present and not in the future beyond configured clock skew. |
| `iss` | Exactly matches the issuer returned by OIDC discovery. |
| `sub` | Present and non-empty. |
| `sandbox.sandboxId` | Exactly matches the selected route ID. |
| `sandbox.sandboxUid` | Exactly matches the selected route UID. |

The verifier parses but does not authorize `aud` or unknown custom claims.
Signature integrity must not be confused with authorization policy; future
metadata- or audience-based authorization requires a separate proposal.

## OIDC Initialization

Each sandbox-gateway process performs the following sequence after Envoy accepts
an enabled filter configuration:

1. Read the CA PEM from a ConfigMap using the controller-runtime API reader.
2. Create an HTTPS client rooted only in that CA, with TLS 1.2 or newer.
3. Fetch the configured OIDC discovery document without following redirects.
4. Read `issuer` and validate that `jwks_uri` is an absolute HTTPS URL.
5. Fetch and validate the JWKS.
6. Atomically publish an immutable verifier to filter workers.

Initialization retries with exponential backoff from one second to 30 seconds.
There are no per-request network calls. Once a verifier is published, it is not
replaced during the process lifetime.

The JWKS loader rejects:

- Empty sets, duplicate or empty `kid` values, and invalid keys.
- Symmetric keys and private keys.
- Keys whose `use` is not signing or whose declared `key_ops` omits `verify`.
- A JWK algorithm incompatible with its key type.

Supported signature algorithms are RSA PKCS#1, RSA-PSS, ECDSA, and Ed25519
algorithms supported by `go-jose`. `alg=none` and HMAC algorithms are rejected.

## Configuration

Envoy filter fields:

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enable-auth` | `false` | Enables gateway authentication. |
| `enable-jwt-auth` | `false` | Selects JWT instead of UUID authentication. |
| `traffic-access-token-header` | `x-traffic-access-token` | Header carrying the compact JWT. |

Gateway environment variables:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` | Required when JWT authentication is enabled |
| `OIDC_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAMESPACE` | Required when JWT authentication is enabled |
| `OIDC_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME` | Required when JWT authentication is enabled |
| `OIDC_CA_CONFIGMAP_KEY` | `ca.crt` |
| `OIDC_CLOCK_SKEW` | `1m` |

Invalid local configuration causes Envoy filter configuration to fail rather
than silently degrading to UUID or unauthenticated access.

JWT mode is process-wide. Per-route filter configurations may inherit or repeat
the process mode, but cannot enable or disable JWT independently.

## Token Acquisition Boundary

This change begins after a client has obtained a traffic access token. It does
not prescribe whether that token comes from an identity-provider SDK, a control
plane, or another trusted service. Sandbox-manager claim/clone processing and
the E2B create response remain unchanged.

## Readiness And Errors

The gateway system server exposes:

- `GET /healthz`: process liveness.
- `GET /readyz`: returns success when JWT is disabled or an enabled verifier is
  published; otherwise returns `503`.

The Deployment readiness probe uses `/readyz` on system port `7789`.

Request failures use these statuses:

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| Enabled verifier not ready | `503 Service Unavailable` |
| Missing, malformed, expired, or invalid JWT | `401 Unauthorized` |
| Sandbox ID or UID mismatch | `401 Unauthorized` |

Error responses do not expose cryptographic details to clients. Detailed
verification errors remain in structured gateway logs.

## RBAC

The gateway requires `get` access to the configured CA ConfigMap in the
identity-provider namespace. Operators enabling JWT authentication must grant
that permission to the `sandbox-gateway` ServiceAccount. A namespaced Role
restricted with `resourceNames` is recommended. The permission is not included
in the default kustomization because the identity-provider namespace and
ConfigMap are deployment-specific.

## Compatibility And Upgrade

- Authentication remains disabled by default in the shipped ConfigMap.
- Existing UUID mode has unchanged request and response behavior.
- Sandbox-manager APIs and Sandbox claim/clone behavior are unchanged.
- No CRD, generated client, or protobuf changes are required.
- Enabling JWT requires the CA ConfigMap, identity-provider connectivity during
  startup, the optional RBAC, and a gateway rollout.
- CA or signing-key rotation requires a gateway rollout because trust material
  is intentionally loaded once.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Identity provider unavailable during startup | Retry with capped exponential backoff and keep readiness false. |
| Unknown key after signing-key rotation | Fail closed and roll gateway pods after publishing the new JWKS. |
| Algorithm confusion | Allow only asymmetric algorithms and require key/algorithm compatibility. |
| Cross-Sandbox replay | Bind both Sandbox ID and immutable UID to the selected route. |
| Traffic token leaks to workloads | Remove the configured token header before forwarding. |
| Initial token eventually expires | Clients must obtain a replacement through the identity system or recreate the Sandbox; refresh-token delivery is future work. |

## Test Plan

Unit tests cover:

- Environment configuration, provider-independent defaults, and validation.
- CA ConfigMap errors, TLS discovery, JWKS loading, response limits, and
  immutable key snapshots.
- Valid and invalid RSA/ECDSA JWTs, unsupported algorithms, signatures, key
  selection, required claims, issuer, skew, token size, and Sandbox binding.
- JWT manager startup ordering, retries, atomic publication, readiness,
  cancellation, idempotency, and concurrent readers.
- Filter configuration, UUID compatibility, JWT success/failure, unavailable
  verifier, route mismatch, custom headers, and header removal.
- Health and readiness handlers.

The JWT E2E profile uses a local HTTPS OIDC discovery/JWKS provider and covers:

- The in-cluster test issuer minting a token for the created Sandbox ID/UID.
- A valid JWT succeeding even when `x-access-token` contains an invalid UUID.
- Missing, malformed, and expired JWTs returning `401`.
- A token issued for Sandbox A being rejected for Sandbox B.

## Alternatives

### Envoy `jwt_authn`

Envoy's native filter can validate JWTs, but the gateway must obtain its CA from
Kubernetes and bind claims to the dynamically selected Sandbox route. Keeping
verification in the existing Go filter provides both capabilities in one path.

### Per-Request Introspection

Calling the identity provider for every request would simplify revocation but
adds latency and creates a traffic-path availability dependency. Offline
verification is preferred for the initial implementation.
